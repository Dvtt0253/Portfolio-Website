                        <p>A digital e-commerce web application that sells eBooks. This website was configured with Flask for its backend logic and HTML, CSS, and Javascript for its frontend logic. It handles standard user functionality such as account creation, user authentication, a shopping cart, and user account management. It also utilizes Flask-Firewall, a custom-built firewall I have developed for protecting Flask web applications against common web vulnerabilities, which is showcased next.  </p>

                        <h2>Flask-Firewall</h2>
                        <p>A web firewall that is configured to protect Flask web applications from common vulnerabilities such as DDoS attacks(Denial of service), SQL and XSS injections, brute force attacks, and CRSF attacks. It enforces rate limits and failed login attempt restrictions to prevent DDoS and brute force attacks. If these limits are surpassed, the firewall sends a warning to the violating IP address and temporarily blacklists it. Repeated violations result in the IP address being permanently blacklisted. Additionally, the firewall sanitizes all user input to detect and block malicious payloads or code injection attempts. If a payload attack is detected, the IP address is permanently blacklisted to prevent future attacks. Moreover, the firewall generates and validates CSRF tokens to simplify the inclusion of CSRF protections.  </p>

                        <p>A web application that integrates a model built with Tensorflow that has been trained on historical market prices of the user's chosen symbol to predict the symbol's future trend direction based on the current price. The model is trained to detect essential patterns within the given market data using an encoder-decoder framework, which is eventually converted into an autoencoder to combine the two processes of compression and reconstruction of the data using the model's learned patterns. The application uses Yahoo Finance to gather real-time and updated market data to ensure that the model's predictions consider the latest market conditions. This website was built with Flask for request and backend handling, and HTML and CSS for its front-end design.  </p>
