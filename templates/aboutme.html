    <div class="text-container">
        <p class="aboutme-text">Hello, I'm Joie, a self-taught full-stack web developer with a passion for building secure and functional web applications.</p>
             <p class="aboutme-text">What started as a hobby—creating web games and simple apps—quickly grew into a lifelong passion for development, with a particular focus on ensuring security in every aspect of the web. Since web and mobile applications are fundamental to our daily lives, it's crucial to implement security measures during the development stage, and I take great interest in ensuring this is done effectively. </p>
            <p class="aboutme-text">With the help of online resources, and the study of various data breach articles, along with personal observation, I have developed the skills to build useful and functioning web applications that prioritize user authentication, securing custom-built private APIs, and secure data handling through minimizing possible exploitable entry-points within the application, while also prioritizing strengthening my skills in building intuitive and interactive user interfaces.</p>
            <p class="aboutme-text">I've recently developed a strong interest in building neural network models with TensorFlow, and I'm actively improving my skills through continuous practice and hands-on projects. I enjoy discovering the endless possibilities this technology offers and creating software that handles tasks that would usually be considered complex. I also find it exciting to integrate these solutions into applications to enhance user functionality.  </p>
            <p class="aboutme-text"> Let's work together to exchange ideas and create secure and conveinient user interfaces that solve daily issues or enhance daily experiences. </p>
